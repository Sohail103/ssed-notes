Ion implantation generally takes place at a lower temperature than diffusion.
A beam of impurity ions is accelerated to kinetic energies in the range of 50 keV
or greater and then directed to the surface of the semiconductor. The high-energy
impurity ions enter the crystal and come to rest at some average depth from the
surface. One advantage of ion implantation is that controlled numbers of impurity
atoms can be introduced into specific regions of the crystal. A disadvantage of this
technique is that the incident impurity atoms collide with the crystal atoms, causing lattice-displacement damage. However, most of the lattice damage can be removed
by thermal annealing, in which the temperature of the crystal is raised for a short
time. Thermal annealing is a required step after implantation.
