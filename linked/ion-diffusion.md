- actual diffusion process depends on material to some extent
- in general, impurity diffusion occurs when a semiconductor crystal is placed in a high temperature (1000 degree C) gaseous atmosphere containing the desired impurity atom
- At this high temperature, many of the crystal atoms can randomly move in and out
  of their single-crystal lattice sites. Vacancies may be created by this random motion so that impurity atoms can move through the lattice by hopping from one vacancy
  to another.
- Impurity diffusion is the process by which impurity particles move from
   a region of high concentration near the surface to a region of lower concentration
   within the crystal. When the temperature decreases, the impurity atoms become per-
   manently frozen into the substitutional lattice sites.
- Diffusion of various impurities into selected regions of a semiconductor allows us to fabricate complex electronic circuits in a single semiconductor crystal.
