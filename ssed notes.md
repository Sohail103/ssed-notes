- schrodingers equation is analogous to newtons laws of motion for the microscopic scale - once you know the wave function at a particular position and at a particular time, it tells you how the wave function evolves
- a particle is assigned a wave function - a complex number is assigned to each point in space and at each moment psi(x,t)
- measurement outcomes in quantum mechanics are probabilistic
- describes microscopic systems (de broglie's wavelength) accurately
- p = h / lambda -> multiply and divide by 2*pi -> p = h(bar) * k (where k = wave vector = 2 * pi / lambda)

- schrodingers equation is a 2nd order partial differential equation - called an eigen value problem

if you plug in the wave function, after applying the differential operators on it you get back the wave function but this time its coefficient is called the eigen value and is equal to the energy of the system

general solution of schrodinger equation: Ae^(ikx) + Be^(-ikx) = Csin(kx) + Dcos(kx)

> **to calculate first 3 energy levels of an electron in an infinite potential well of given width type questions: E = hbar^2 k^2/2m and k = n x pi / L**

wave functions form a complete set - electron has to take any of these states or a linear combination of these states

in infinite potential well - regions past the barriers have 0 probability of having an electron
in finite potential well - regions past the barriers have non 0 probability of having an electron there - **tunneling**

probability of electron being present past the barrier in finite potential well increases with electron energy

atom is a finite potential well in 3 dimensions - 
quantum number n represents radial confinement
l and m represent symmetry in the azimuthal and polar directions

s, p, d and f are the probability distributions in 3 dimensional space 

m can go from -l to +l -> degeneracy of orbitals

- Defects - vacancy, interstitial, frenkel (interaction between vacancy and interstitial defect in close proximity), line dislocation - affect the geometric periodicity and ideal atomic bonds
- thermal vibration disturbs only the normal geometric periodicity 
- impurities - substitutional impurities, interstitial impurities
- doping - [impurity diffusion](ion-diffusion.md), [ion-implantation](ion-implantation.md)
